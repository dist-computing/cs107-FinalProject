Names:
* Matheus C. Fernandes
* Haipeng Lin
* Ben Manning
* *TF: Johnathan Jiang

## Git Workflow
* Create your own branch in `feature/name`
* Commit changes and resolve merge conflicts by `git merge main`
* Submit pull request to `main`
* Approve and merge to `main` 

### Collaborative workflow in Deepnote
To facilitate coding, we used a shared deepnote project to create shared commits under the `group/*` branches.

* Use Jupyter Notebook `%%writefile` to save into the `cs107-FinalProject` folder in Deepnote;
* Use the terminal to `git commit` staged files as appropriate;
* Create the pull request and ask another teammate for approval.


### Broader Impact & Inclusivity Statement

For the Awesome Automatic Differentiation project, we had a diverse team of individuals from a variety of backgrounds
contribute to all parts of the codebase. Our team brought in a diverse set of perspectives not only from our lived 
experience - which is essential to assessing inclusivity, but from an academic sense of diversity. For lived experience we come
from three different countries and have lived in a variety of urban and rural settings. Additionally our team speaks multiple languages
that we can use in order to communicate with external parties who want to work with us. Academically, we work in 
environmental sciences, applied mathematics and public policy, which has allowed our interdisciplinary team to assess 
the impact of our work from a variety of perspecitives - both ethical and quantitative. In the process of approving 
pull requests and assessing code, each member of our time approved all parts of the work through intensive reading
and discussion, which allowed our disparate academic lenses to assess the strengths and weaknesses of our work. No decisions were made by just one person. Because of the diversity
of perspective of our team, we believe our code is accessible to the vast majority of people. In the future, however,
we would hope to add a female perspective to our code review and work, as we were assigned an all male team. This was a glaring
weakness of our team that we were unable to fix, but will moving forward. We recognize that this could be a barrier to women
using our code - so we will try to fix it by diversifying our team

We plan to publish our code as open source - which comes with a variety of risks. We cannot explicitly control
the parties that use our code, but we will have public warnings attached to the documentation in the future. We recognize
that individuals performing computation projects with nefarious and descriminatory goals (either knowlingly or unknowingly)
could access our work. We will work to make sure that they are not contributing to our code base through assesssing of previous 
work and character before approval.

We want people to use our software as a tool for good - no matter what the projects. A final step that we believe is essential
to propogating this subjective 'good' is for other teams to write impact statements. We see this as a superb practice in self-reflection,
and before improving external contributions, we would want to see impact and inclusivity statements. However, if there's were for some reason
triggering to write for an individual, we would make ecxeptions.

In summation, we have worked to make this software inclusive with positive impact. However, inclusivity and impact
are never complete. We will keep flexible and open minds to continue thinking about how are software can be improved
both in its quantitative power and who it effects.
