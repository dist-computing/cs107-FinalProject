We do so by breaking down each equation into to elementary arithmetic operations\nsuch as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, expoential, logarithmic, cos, sin, tan, etc. \nTo perform this process, automatic differentiation uses the power of the chain rule to brake down derivatives of composit functions into easily solvable components.\nThe benefit of following this approach is that it allows the derivative evaluation to be as accurate as possible up to computer precision, unlike numerical differentiation. \n\nAutomatic differentiation is benefitial because it can be used in two ways. The forward and the reverse accumulation. \nThe workings of each of the two modes are described in more detail below.\n\n## Forward Accumulation \nIn this mode we break down the equation by following chain rule as we would when doing it by hand. This approach is benefitial to compute accurate differentiation of pf matrix producs such as Jacobians. \nBecause AD method inherently keeps track of all operations in a table, this becomes very efficient for evaulation other types higher order derivative based matrices such as Hessians. \n\n## Reverse Accumulation\nIn this mode, the dependent variable is fixed and the derivative is computed backward recursively. This means that this accumulation type travels through the chainrule in a backward fashion, namely, from the outside toward the inside.\nBecause of its similarity to backpropagation, namely, backpropagation of errors in multilayer perceptrons are a special case of reverse mode, this type of computational coding is a very efficient way of computing these backpropagations of error\nand ultimatly enables the ability to optimize a the weights in a neural network.\n\n### Example Evaluation Trace for a Simple Neural Network\n![](https://aad.fer.me/assets/images/P2_graph.png)\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-968f1c9a-43f2-40b4-a19c-5d413760cbee","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-e005a295-8715-45e3-ae90-83c8cbdbbbae","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How to use _AAD_ (\"Awesome Automatic Differentiation\")\n\n## Quick Initialization\n\n* `git clone` this package repository into your project directory.\n* Install dependencies using `pip`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n* Import our package using the following:\n    * `from AAD import as AD` *for AAD objects*\n    * `from AADFunction import as ADF` *for vector valued functions*\n    * `from solvers.Newton import AAD_Newton` *for Newton's Method*\n    * `from solvers.GradientDescent import AAD_grad` *for Gradient Descent*\n    * `from solvers.GMRES import AAD_GMRES` *for GMRES*\n* Run the tests; either using `pytest` or the manual test python script at `python ./tests/run_tests.py`.\n* Consult the documentation for quick examples to get started.\n\n## How to Install using Conda to create an environment\nIt is good practice to use virtual environments (such as [Anaconda](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/anaconda-project)) to prevent tampering with your existing package installation in `python`.\n\nAs a quick reference, you can install `AAD` with `conda` with a new environment using the following commands:\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:dist-computing/cs107-FinalProject.git AAD\ncd AAD\nconda create --name AAD python=3.8\nconda install -n AAD requirements.txt\n```\nTo activate the environment later, simply use `source activate AAD`.\n\n## How to install as a package from `pip`\nIf you prefer the distribution to be installed using PyPI, then install the `aad-jimmielin` package:\n```\npip install aad-jimmielin\n```\nImport package contents from the `AAD.` package namespace using:\n```python\nfrom AAD.AADVariable import AADVariable\n```\n\nAn interactive example:\n```\n$ python -m pip install --upgrade aad-jimmielin\nCollecting aad-jimmielin\n  Downloading aad_jimmielin-1.1.1-py3-none-any.whl (7.3 kB)\nSuccessfully installed aad-jimmielin-1.1.1\n\n$ python\nPython 3.7.9 (default, Oct 13 2020, 21:10:49) \n[GCC 8.3.0] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from AAD.AADVariable import AADVariable\n>>> x = AADVariable(1.0, [1,0])\n>>> y = AADVariable(2.0, [0, 1])\n>>> x*y\nAADVariable fun = 2.0, der = [2. 1.]\n\n>>> from AAD.AADFunction import AADFunction\n>>> f = AADFunction([x+1, y*x])\n>>> print(f)\n[AADFunction fun = [2.0, 2.0], der = [[1. 0.]\n [2. 1.]]]\n>>> \n```\n\n\n## Code example (univariate)\nYou can create a driver script at the top level, e.g. `my_code.py`, and include the following code to use the `AAD` package:\n\n```python\nimport AAD as AD\nimport math\n#Evaluate the derivative of log(x) at x = 4\nx = 4 #initial value of x\nmy_AD = AD.AADVariable(4) #creating the AAD object\nmy_AD = AD.log(my_AD) #applying a function to the object to find both the value and derivative\n#Prints value of log and derivative at x = 4\nprint(my_AD)\n```\nAnswer:\n```\nAADVariable fun = 1.3862943611198906, der = 0.25\n```\n\n### Toy implementation of Newton's Method\n**You can retrieve the Jacobian (or scalar derivative) by tapping into the `.der` attribute of the `AAD`, or using the `.jacobian()` function on a `AADVariable` object.**\n\nWith this you can solve for roots on functions, with the Newton's Method, i.e. for `sin(x)`:\n\n```python\n# Newton's Method for solving root (toy implementation, we have a better one!)\n# of f(x) = sin(x)\nx0 = AADVariable(2.0)\nfor i in range(1, 20): # do 20 iterations maximum\n    fx = sin(x0)\n    x1 = x0.val - fx.val/fx.der\n    if abs(x0.val - x1) > 10e-6: # larger than minimum tolerance?\n        x0 = AADVariable(x1)\n    else:\n        break\nprint(x0.val) # Final solution\n```\nThis prints\n```\n3.1415926536808043\n```\n\n## Advanced Examples\n### Multivariate usage\n`AAD` fully supports vector-based inputs and outputs for its functions. For vector inputs, **variables are not named but instead identified by a positional vector** (\"seed vector\").\nWe believe this implementation is more flexible and allows for arbitrary number of input components with a clear mathematical meaning.\n\nMultiple variables are communicated to the `AADVariable` dual number class using the second argument (derivative `der`) as a vector, i.e.\n`[1, 0]` is the first variable, `[0, 1]` is the second. Of course, specifying `(x+y)` as a composite variable using `[1, 1]` is also supported.\n\nA two-variable example:\n```python\nx = AADVariable(1.0, [1, 0]) # x = 1.0\ny = AADVariable(2.0, [0, 1]) # y = 2.0\nscalar = 6.0\n\nprint(x + y - scalar) # AADVariable fun = -3.0, der = [1 1]\nprint(x * y - scalar) # AADVariable fun = -4.0, der = [2. 1.]\nprint((x + 0.5*y)/10) # 0.1x+0.05y, AADVariable fun = 0.2, der = [0.1  0.05]\n```\n\nAs you can see, each indexed entry in the derivative correspond to the partial derivative with respect to that variable.\n\n**How can I add more variables?** The code is flexible and enables adding more variables without changing the previous seed vectors. e.g. the following will work:\n```python\nx = AADVariable(1.0, [1, 0]) # x = 1.0\ny = AADVariable(2.0, [0, 1]) # y = 2.0\nz = AADVariable(9.0, [0, 0, 1]) # z = 9.0\nprint(x*y*z) # AADVariable fun = 18.0, der = [18.  9.  2.]\n```\n\nThe `AADVariable` parser automatically zero-pads required derivative arrays, thus the following will work just fine:\n```python\nx = AADVariable(1.0, [1]) # x = 1.0\ny = AADVariable(2.0, [0, 1]) # y = 2.0\nz = AADVariable(9.0, [0, 0, 1]) # z = 9.0\n```\n\nFor compatibility, **if only one variable is detected, all values are returned as scalars**, otherwise they return a `np.ndarray`.\n\n### Vector-valued functions - the `AADFunction` class\nFor vector valued functions, they need to be wrapped in the `AADFunction` class to be tracked correctly. An example:\n\n```python\nx = AADVariable(1.0, [1]) # either not specifying der, [1], or [1 0] or [1,0,0] will all work, as above\ny = AADVariable(2.0, [0, 1]) \nf = AADFunction([x+y, x-y])\nprint(f)\n```\n\nThis prints:\n```\n[AADFunction fun = [3.0, -1.0], der = [[ 1  1]\n [ 1 -1]]]\n ```\n\nWhere you can see that the Jacobian is `[1 1; 1 -1]`. The value and the derivative are retrieved from `f.val()` and `f.der()` methods, respectively.\n\n\n## How to use AAD's Optimization and Solver Suite\nAAD includes an awesome set of optimizers and solvers for scalar and vector-valued functions, including:\n* `Newton`'s method for finding roots. Usable for linear and non-linear scalar or vector-valued functions.\n* `GMRES` (generalized minimal residual method) for finding roots. Used for linear scalar or vector-valued functions.\n* A `GradientDescent` optimizer.\n\n### Examples\n#### Gradient Descent Optimizer\nTo optimize using the Gradient Descent optimizer, specify the function using `def Function(X):` where X is a vector composed \nof the different variables. If the function only contains one variable X should be a vector with only one entry.  Note that the \ninitial values also must be a vectored list with the same dimensions as the function.\n```python\nimport AAD as AD\nfrom solvers.GradientDescent import AAD_grad\nx = AD.AADVariable(3, [1 ,0])\ny = AD.AADVariable(2, [0, 1])\n\nsolve = AAD_grad.solve(lambda X: AD.abs(2*X[0]-12+2*X[1]**2),[x,y],0.001,progress_step=5000,max_iter=10000)\n```\n\n#### Newton's method root solver\nTo solve roots using Newton's Method, simply specify the functions using Python's lambda function features.\n\n```python\nfrom solvers.Newton import AAD_Newton\nprint(AAD_Newton.solve(lambda x, y, z, a: [x+4*y-z+a, a-2, y*5+z*0.1, x+2*a], [1, 1, 1, 1])) # [-4.0, 0.03703703703703704, -1.851851851851852, 2.0]\nprint(AAD_Newton.solve(lambda x: [x*y+1, 3*x+5*y-1], [1])) # two sets of roots; the one solved here is [-1.1350416126511096, 0.8810249675906657]; depends on initial guess\n```\n\nWhat's happening under the hood?\n* The lambda function is translated to a set of `AADVariable` multi-variate inputs. **We use lambda functions so we can have \"faux\" symbolic math and it looks pretty.**\n* The function results are wrapped in `AADFunction` and automatically differentiated.\n* Newton's method is used to solve the equation.\n\n#### GMRES\nGMRES only works for linear functions. The method signature is similar to the Newton's method above:\n\n```python\nfrom solvers.GMRES import AAD_GMRES\nprint(AAD_GMRES.solve(lambda x, y: [x+y+5, 3*x-y+1], [0.5, 1.5])) # [-1.5, -3.5]\nprint(AAD_GMRES.solve(lambda x: [x-2], [300])) # [2.0]\n```","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-76967f3e-3039-4759-b65e-9c376f3d0af2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Organization\n\n## Directory structure and modules\n* We will have a main importable class that contains the directions for each function and how to use them. \n\n```\nREADME.md\ndemos/                   Final Presentation with appropriate helper files\n   Presentation.ipynb    Final Presentatoin\n   ...\ndocs/                    Contains the documentation for the project.\n   README.md\n   documentation.ipynb   The main documentation.\n   milestone1.ipynb\n   milestone2.ipynb\n   milestone2_progress.ipynb\n   ...\ncode/                     Source files\n   AADUtils.py              Utilities used as support functions (internal)\n   AAD.py                   Main constructor and dual number forward-mode implementation=\n   AADFunction.py           Vector-valued functions wrapper\n\n   solvers/\n      GradientDescent.py    Gradient-descent optimizer\n      Newton.py             Newton root finder (vector-valued, linear and nonlinear functions)\n      GMRES.py              Generalized Minimum-Residual Method root finder (vector-valued, linear functions)\n\ntests/                   Contains the test suite for the project\n   run_tests.py             Runs all of the tests it the folder\n   test_funtion.py         Tests Vector Valued Functions of AD Variables\n   test_gmres.py           Tests for GMRES\n   test_graddesc.py        Tests for gradient descent\n   test_main.py            Contains operations overrides and tests of complex functions for one variable\n   test_newton.py          Tests for newton's method\n   test_utils.py           Tests internal utilities\n```\n\n## Modules\n\n* The modules that we will use are `numpy`, `math`, `SimPy`, `SciPy`\n   * `numpy` will be used in order to evaluate and analyze arrays.\n   * `math` will be used in for its access to simple mathematical functions.\n   * `SimPy` will potentially be used to take symbolic derivatives and will be useful in our test suite.

The dual number\nclass is `AADVariable` supporting scalar and vector inputs, and vector valued functions are supported by a `AADFunction`\nauxiliary type.\n\nInternal data structures include the `numpy.ndarray` data type and number types.\n\n## Classes and method signatures\n### The `AAD` dual number class\nThis is a single variable dual number with forward-mode automatic differentiation. Includes representation and string functions, i.e. `__repr__` and `__str__`.\n\nAllows retrieval of the function value (i.e. `.val`) and derivative (scalar \"jacobian\") value (i.e. `.der`).\n\n### The `AAD` class\nIncludes APIs used for performing Automatic Differentiation, as of the current version, AAD can handle single varibale differentiation that include terms using the following elementary functions:\n\n* `exp(x)` euler's number to the power of x\n* `log(x)` natural log of x\n* `sin(x)` sine of x\n* `sinh(x)` hyperbolic sin of x\n* `cos(x)` cosine of x \n* `cosh(x)` hyperbolic cosine of x\n* `tan(x)` tangent of x\n* `tanh(x)` hyperbolic tangent of x \n* `arcsin(x)` inverse sine of x\n* `arccos(x)` inverse cosine of x\n* `arctan(x)` inverse tangent of x\n* `sqrt(x)` square root of x\n\nAdditionally, the Jacobian can be returned through calling its method:\n\n* `x.jacobian()` -- returns the jacobian of the AADVariable Object.\n\n### Attributes\n\nOur classes will have the following attributes\n* `__init__(val, der 0, name = none)` -- initialization and all variables where val is the value, der is the derivative and name is the name of the variable\n* `.der` -- provides the derivative of the function at the original point\n* `.val` -- provides the value of the function at the original point\n* `.name` -- used for future upgrades to software\n\n### External dependencies\n\nFor matrix support, this software package requires `numpy`, `math`, `SimPy`, `SciPy`.\n\n### Vector Valued Functions\n\nFor these functions we will evaluate each element of the vector valued function independently and then move on to the next element.\nWe will store each evaluation in a numpy array - akin to a jacobian to output the correct derivative.\n\n### Elementary Operators\n\nWe will overload the addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and power operators to work within our software using\nthe baseline dunder methods and the reverse versions.\n\nThe Following Elementary Operators have been overriden: \n* `__rmul__`,  `__mul__`, `__neg__`, `__add__`, `__radd__`, `__sub__`, `__rsub__`\n*  `__truediv__`, `__rtruediv__`, `__pow__`, `__rpow__`, `__repr__`\n\nThese overrides accept real numbers, but do not assume real numbers. They can be used with multile AADVariable Objects\n\nThse overriden operators allow for seamless operations and combindations of operations that include:\n* Power operations: `2**x` or `x**2`\n* Multiplication operations: `x*2` or `2*x` or `sin(x)*cos(x)`\n* Negative operations:  `x-3` or `3-x` or `sin(x)-cos(x)`\n* Division operations: `x/4` or `4/x` or `sin(x)/cos(x)`\n* Addition operations: `x+5` or `5+x` or `sin(x)+cos(x)`\n\n\n\n### Elementary functions\nElementary functions are implemented using built-in Python `math` and the `numpy` package and include ready-made implementations for `Dual` numbers in this package.\n\nTo deal with elementary functions such as `sin`, `log` and `exp` we will manually evaluate them and add them to a database to query continuously using the chain rule.\n* The derivative of `sin(x)` = `x' * cos (x)`\n* The derivative of `log(x)` = `x' * 1/x`\n* The derivative of `exp(x)` = `x' * exp(x)`\n\nAdditionally, for other all other functions in the AAD class we perform the same process, with the chain rule.\n    ","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-08d08c82-371f-4d93-929b-134ffbf73010","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# New Feature\n### Newton's Method\nThe Newton's Method solver uses the `AAD`'s automatic differentiation core to solve systems of linear and non-linear equations.

It uses the gradient to minimize the function and follow the descent of the funciton \ntopology. It does that by updating the location and obtaining the gradient at that location of the function namely:\n\n$$\na_{n+1}=a_n-\\gamma\\nabla F(a_n)\n$$\n\nWhere $a_{n+1}$ is the new point based on the previous point $a_n$ updated by the gradient of the function evaluated at the \nprevious point $$\\gamma\\nabla F(a_n)$$, where $$\\gamma$$ provides the step size. \n\n### GMRES\n\nThe GMRES (generalized minimal residual method) solver uses `AAD`'s automatic differentiation core to solve systems of **linear** equations.\n\nWhen given a system of $k$ linear equations for the function (i.e. linear operator) $F: \\mathbb{R}^k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^k$ with a nonsingular Jacobian matrix\n$J_F(x_n)$, we can *iteratively* solve by applying the GMRES solver to the **action** of the operator $F$ on a seed vector $v$, to yield $\\Delta x_k$ for the\nnext iteration.

Our team brought in a diverse set of perspectives not only from our lived \nexperience - which is essential to assessing inclusivity, but from an academic sense of diversity. For lived experience we come\nfrom three different countries and have lived in a variety of urban and rural settings. Additionally our team speaks multiple languages\nthat we can use in order to communicate with external parties who want to work with us. Academically, we work in \nenvironmental sciences, applied mathematics and public policy, which has allowed our interdisciplinary team to assess \nthe impact of our work from a variety of perspecitives - both ethical and quantitative. In the process of approving \npull requests and assessing code, each member of our time approved all parts of the work through intensive reading\nand discussion, which allowed our disparate academic lenses to assess the strengths and weaknesses of our work. No decisions were made by just one person. Because of the diversity\nof perspective of our team, we believe our code is accessible to the vast majority of people. In the future, however,\nwe would hope to add a female perspective to our code review and work, as we were assigned an all male team. This was a glaring\nweakness of our team that we were unable to fix, but will moving forward. We recognize that this could be a barrier to women\nusing our code - so we will try to fix it by diversifying our team\n\nWe plan to publish our code as open source - which comes with a variety of risks. We cannot explicitly control\nthe parties that use our code, but we will have public warnings attached to the documentation in the future. We recognize\nthat individuals performing computation projects with nefarious and descriminatory goals (either knowlingly or unknowingly)\ncould access our work. We will work to make sure that they are not contributing to our code base through assesssing of previous \nwork and character before approval.\n\nWe want people to use our software as a tool for good - no matter what the projects. A final step that we believe is essential\nto propogating this subjective 'good' is for other teams to write impact statements. We see this as a superb practice in self-reflection,\nand before improving external contributions, we would want to see impact and inclusivity statements. However, if there's were for some reason\ntriggering to write for an individual, we would make ecxeptions.\n\nIn summation, we have worked to make this software inclusive with positive impact. However, inclusivity and impact\nare never complete. We will keep flexible and open minds to continue thinking about how are software can be improved\nboth in it's quantitative power and who it effects.\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00007-b1097373-6d18-423e-a490-8915d1fce6e4","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Future Features & Ideas\n\nAs an additional extension of this project, we would like to implement the reverse\nmode scheme of automaotic differentiation. Having this toolset in addition to optimizers \nis extremely valuable in the field of AI as it allows one to efficiently compute the backwardpropagation\nof errors in multilayer perceptions (i.e. neural networks). Being able\nto try different optimization schemes in addition to backward propogation will be useful in order to test the efficiency\nof different implementations. The implementation of backwardpropagation\nof neural networks is essnetiall a special case of reverse mode AD with an added set of \nelementary functions. These elementary functions are called activation functions some of\nwhich are already implemented in this version of the software. Here is a comprehensive list \nof new and already implemented functions we plan on incorporating into the future version\nof this software.\n\n\n**New Functions**: `relu`, `leaky relu`, `sigmoid`, `swish`, `softmax`, `binary step`\n\n**Already implemented**: `linear`, `tanh`\n\nFurthermore, as an additional step in this project, we would like to propose creating a framework\nfor adding personalized optimizers and root finders so that users can define their own \nalgorithm and test its performance with other algorithms for a particular reverse mode neural network.\nWe would like to also create a vizualization toolset where users are able to compare the training, testing,\nand timing performce of their code in comparison to the built in optimizatio/root-finding algorithm.\nThis will give the users an idea of what would be the best scheme for their particular application.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00008-7b97f3c6-e799-4c41-a83a-270a5705534e","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00009-1bfa2ba1-560e-4b75-a727-f6bcfa3da0f6","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.3"},"deepnote_notebook_id":"79e9f0bc-45b3-48f9-a08d-1a7ed12a1dbb","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
